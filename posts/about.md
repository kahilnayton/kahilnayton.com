### About

As to be expected after spending about 6 years in NYC after moving there from Australia I was feeling the need to reconnect with home and family. The obvious way to do that since there was half a world between us was to start writing some music with my sister, so in 2018 popped into the Avery studio while on a trip back in Melbourne. We tracked the better part of 3 tracks, called the project Bonds and I went ahead and finished up the production in NYC. The result of this was some pretty raw original music, but it has a vibe and I dig it. I had never really gone through the process of releasing original music before where I was doing a good bit of the singing, writing and playing of the instrucments and it left me keen to pick up the guitar and keep writing.
