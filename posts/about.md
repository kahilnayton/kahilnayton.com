### About

I am Kahil. Originally from Australia, I moved to New York City in 2011 and have been making music here ever since. Iâ€™ve played in bands such as [Regional de NY](https://open.spotify.com/track/5i2FKbQvwR2ZJoOc1qCaZ3?si=16ee82f4d4654162), [Bonds](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2AGbrwPzOcQMAVjLgNDOZd?si=DWxFf2eZRtef9LCE3DVOuw), [The Shaolin Afronauts](https://open.spotify.com/track/6k6JSwl4Xs9goFC8VZ098l?si=3c72457467864fbf) & [The Transatlantic](https://open.spotify.com/track/6a3Tg3l7s8uXQrLsSNJt4Y?si=830661c834ba4b55), to name a few. 

After six years in NYC, I started writing music with my sister for our project Bonds; we recorded our first EP at the Avery Studio in Melbourne. Releasing music as Bonds inspired me to start making music under my own name in 2020.

In 2022 I will be releasing a new album titled Wayfinding. You can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kahilnayton/?hl=en) to keep up to date for this album as well as other music i'm working on.
