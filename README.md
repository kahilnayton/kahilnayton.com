**choro**
Choro (pronounced SHOH-roh) is best described in American terms as "the New Orleans jazz of Brazil." It is a complex popular musical form based on improvisation, and like New Orleans jazz, blues, or ragtime, grew from a formalized musical structure and many worldly influences. But to the people of South America, choro is Brazil. It is life. Our band Regional De NY often plays around NYC, come hang!





**NFT**
I'm a bit of a crypto nerd and though it would be fun to tokanize this new release, so if you want to buy some non fudgable tokens or if you are interested in the crypto space. I feel like the way streaming is currently set up musos kinda get a rough deal and although it's early days maybe block chain tech can help empower creatives in the future. Happy to chat about the process if you're interested to learn!

**New Video**
Some time ago now a good mate had an idea for a music clip for one of my songs. The subsequent events from this video clip became quite the story. I'll write some words abot it shortly because the world should know, but for the time being...

**Band Camp**
Bandcamp is a great way to show some support, not just for this music, but for all musicians. Spitify pays bugger all to artists so if you like someone's music go buy it on Bandcamp. Some of the guys who played on these tracks have some particulary good stuff.
